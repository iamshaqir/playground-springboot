# Composite with @IdClass, @Embedded, @Embeddable
1. Need to create a separate class.
2. Need to implement serializable
    Composite keys are custom classes, so if we want pass that in network it should be serializable as jpa needs to make
    sure the composite class is serializable
3. Override equals and hashcode()
    JPA internally maintains FIRST LEVEL CACHING, and we can Implement SECOND LEVEL CACHING, these cache internally uses
    HashMap and relies on key(generally primary key becomes the key), so to avoid collision proper equals() and
    hashcode() needed.
4. Should have default constructor
